# SQL - Employee Tracker

## The Task

For Challenge #12 the task was to create an interface to easily view and interact with information of a employees database. This interface is a command-line application that uses Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL. The user can interact running the application in the command-line and manipulating the information of the employees database easily through inquirer options. 

Because this application is not deployed, a demostrate video link is added in Mock-Up section.

SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```
